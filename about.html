      <p>
        Naruto (NARUTO -ナルト-) is a manga by Masashi Kishimoto with an anime
        TV series adaptation. Its main character, Naruto Uzumaki, is a loud,
        hyperactive, adolescent ninja who constantly searches for approval and
        recognition, as well as to become Hokage, who is acknowledged as the
        leader and strongest of all ninja in the village.
      </p>
      <p>
        The manga was first published by Shueisha in 1999 in the 43rd issue of
        Japan's Shōnen Jump magazine. VIZ Media publishes a translated version
        in the American Shōnen Jump, and is currently within a few volumes of
        the Japanese publication. Naruto has become VIZ Media's best-selling
        manga series.
      </p>
      <p>
        The animated television series, produced by Studio Pierrot and Aniplex,
        premiered across Japan on the terrestrial TV Tokyo network and the anime
        satellite television network Animax on October 3, 2002, and stopped
        airing in 23rd March 2017. Viz also licensed the anime for North
        American production. Naruto debuted in the United States on Cartoon
        Network's Toonami programming block on September 10, 2005, and in Canada
        on YTV's Bionix on September 16, 2005. Naruto began showing in the UK on
        Jetix on July 22, 2006. It began showing on Toasted TV on January 12,
        2007 in Australia, although it could be watched on Cartoon Network in
        2006. The first series lasted nine seasons, while the second began its
        first on February 15, 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
        In November 22, 2012, VP of Strategic Marketing and Promotions for
        Cartoon Network, Jason DeMarco, announced Naruto would make a come back
        to Toonami, now a block on Adult Swim on Saturday, December 1, 2012.
        Additionally, they mentioned that it would be uncut. The show started
        all the way back at episode 1 and was removed from the schedule after
        episode 52 on November 30, 2013 due to Toonami announced will be
        premieres January, 5 on Naruto: Shippūden.

      <h3 class="section-heading">Anime Details</h3>
      <p>
        Even though it debuted some time after the manga, the anime quickly
        caught up, since one anime episode usually covers one or two manga
        chapters. To prevent overlapping, the anime's producers tend to organise
        content from the manga chapters into long, uneventful sections followed
        by short bursts of action, sometimes adding filler content in between.
        By the time the Sasuke Recovery Mission ended in the anime (episode
        135), the series was at a point where it was quickly gaining on the
        manga. At the conclusion of this arc, the anime immediately switched to
        anime-only episodes to allow the manga to broaden the gap once more.
        Most of these episodes are stand-alone stories, with a few being part of
        arcs that were several episodes long, and lasted for a total of 85
        episodes in the first series.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the series moved back into manga-adapted episodes, it was renamed
        Naruto: Shippūden (ナルト 疾風伝, Naruto Shippūden, literally meaning:
        Naruto Hurricane Chronicles). The new series premiered on February 15,
        2007.
      </p>
      <p>
        The anime generally remains true to the manga, usually changing only
        minor details (causes of death, loss of limbs, and other injuries have
        been lessened in the anime) or expanding on parts skipped by the manga,
        such as the fight between Tenten and Temari. The anime-only arcs, though
        unreferenced in the manga (save for a few scant scenes), deal with the
        breaks between manga volumes, which covers a short period before the
        Sasuke Recovery Mission and several months before the time skip. The
        anime-only arcs tend to cover the supporting characters, occasionally
        giving insight into an otherwise rarely seen character.

      <h3 class="section-heading">Plot Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Twelve years before the events at the focus of the series, the
        Nine-Tailed Demon Fox attacked Konohagakure. It was a powerful demon; a
        single swing of one of its nine tails would raise tsunamis and flatten
        mountains. It raised chaos and caused the deaths of many, until the
        leader of Konoha, the Fourth Hokage, defeated it by sacrificing his own
        life to seal the demon inside a newly-born child. That child's name was
        Naruto Uzumaki.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Fourth Hokage was celebrated as a hero for sealing the Nine-Tails
        away. He wanted Naruto to be respected in a similar light by being the
        containment vessel for the Nine-Tails. The village he grew up in,
        however, mostly shunned Naruto; they regarded him as if he were the
        Nine-Tails itself and mistreated him throughout most of his childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        A decree made by the Third Hokage made it so that the other villagers
        were forbidden to mention the event to anyone, even to their own
        children. However, this did not stop them from treating Naruto like an
        outcast. Although their children did not specifically know why their
        parents treated Naruto the way they did, they learned through example to
        despise the boy. As a result, Naruto grew up as an orphan in a lonesome
        atmosphere without friends, family, or acknowledgement. He could not
        force people to befriend him, so he sought acknowledgement and attention
        the only way he knew through pranks and mischief. However, that soon
        changed after Naruto graduated from the Academy by using his Multiple
        Shadow Clone Technique to save his teacher, Iruka Umino, from the
        renegade ninja Mizuki. That encounter gave Naruto two insights: that he
        was the container of the Nine-Tails, and that there was someone besides
        the Third Hokage who actually cared about him. His graduation from the
        academy opened a gateway to the events and people that would change and
        define his world, including his way of the ninja for the rest of his
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naruto maintains a balance between drama and comedy, with plenty of
        action interspersed. It follows Naruto and his friends' personal growth
        and development as ninja, and emphasises their interactions with each
        other and the influence of their backgrounds on their personalities.
        Naruto finds two friends and comrades in Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura
        Haruno, two fellow young ninja who are assigned with him to form a
        three-person team under a very experienced sensei named Kakashi Hatake.
        Naruto also confides in other characters as well that he has met through
        the Chūnin Exam. They learn new abilities, get to know each other and
        other villagers better, and experience a coming-of-age journey as Naruto
        dreams of becoming the Hokage of Konoha.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naruto places strong emphasis on character development. Almost all
        outcomes are a result of decisions, character, and personality; very few
        things happen just because of chance. At first, emphasis is placed on
        Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura, who are the members of Team 7. However,
        other characters are developed, such as Kakashi, Guy, and Jiraiya, as
        well as Naruto's peers in the other Genin teams and other villages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several major villains came into play as well, the first being Zabuza
        Momochi, a missing-nin from the Kirigakure, and his partner, Haku.
        Later, in the Chūnin Exam Arc, Orochimaru is introduced as an S-Class
        missing-nin at the top of Konoha's most wanted list, along with other
        Otogakure ninja, including Kabuto Yakushi, Team Dosu and the Sound Four.
        Later, a mysterious organisation called Akatsuki begins to pursue Naruto
        in order to take the Nine-Tails inside him and harness its power.

      <p>
        Naruto has a large and colourful cast of characters, running a gamut of
        detailed histories and complex personalities, and allowing many of them
        their fair share in the spotlight; they are also seen to grow and mature
        with the series, as it spans several years. As fitting for a
        coming-of-age saga, Naruto's world constantly expands and thickens, and
        his social relations are no exception during his introduction he has
        only his teacher and the village's leader for sympathetic figures, but
        as the story progresses, more and more people become a part of his
        story.
      </p>
      <p>
        The students at the Academy, where the story begins, are split up into
        teams of three after their graduation and become genin. Each team is
        assigned an experienced sensei. These core teams form a basis for the
        characters' interactions later in the series, where characters are
        chosen for missions for their team's strength and complementary skills;
        Naruto's Team 7 becomes the social frame where Naruto is acquainted with
        Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, and their sensei Kakashi Hatake, also
        called the "copy ninja" for copying thousands of ninja techniques with
        his Sharingan, forming the core of his world-in-the-making. The other
        three-man teams of his former classmates form another such layer, as
        Naruto connects with them to various degrees, learning of their motives,
        vulnerabilities, and aspirations, often relating them to his own. The
        groups of three are not limited to the comrades Naruto's age groups in
        the story in general come in threes and multiples of three with very few
        exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sensei-student relationships play a significant role in the series;
        Naruto has a number of mentors with whom he trains and learns, most
        notably Kakashi Hatake and Jiraiya, and there are often running threads
        of tradition and tutelage binding together several generations. These
        role models provide guidance for their students not only in the ninja
        arts but also in a number of Japanese aesthetics and philosophical
        ideals. Techniques, ideals, and mentalities noticeably run in families,
        Naruto often being exposed to the abilities and traditions of
        generation-old clans in his village when friends from his own age group
        demonstrate them, or even achieve improvements of their own; it is
        poignantly noted that Naruto's generation is particularly talented.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the greater lingering mysteries of the series are questions of
        character motives and identity. The legacy of Naruto's parents, the
        goals that guide Kabuto Yakushi, the identity of the mysterious Akatsuki
        leader these are only a few of the fundamental unanswered questions of
        "who" and, by proxy, "why" currently at the core of the series. The
        story is remarkably character-driven; the theme of causality runs
        inherently throughout the series as characters reciprocate for their
        past actions and relationships. In this respect, characters' respective
        destinies are very much intertwined, and large emphasis is placed on
        comradeship and 'bonds' between the community or individual.
